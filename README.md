# Image-Classification
There is an image classification problem where our goal  will be to classify some images and tell for  each image the class of the image.
Convolutional Neural Network are great deep learning models for computer vision, to classify some images, some photographs, or even some videos. We will train a Convolutional Neural Network to predict the class of the images.
We are working with very simple images, images of cats and dogs. But then you will be able to replace them by whatever images we want if we need to predict some categories for our images.
